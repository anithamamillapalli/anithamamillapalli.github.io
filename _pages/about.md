I was always fascinated by science, which motivated me to do my master’s in chemistry with a gold medal. The interphase of chemistry and biology is fascinating, and I pursued my Ph.D. in Human Genetics from Jawaharlal Nehru University, New  Delhi under the guidance of Prof. RNK Bamezai. We have identified the first Bloom Syndrome patient from India and we worked on discovering the candidate gene for Bloom syndrome. We could not identify it but learnt a lot about the disease biology. I moved later for my post-doctoral studies to ICGEB on a collaborative DBT malaria
research project between Malaria Research Centre and ICGEB. Moved my area of research and was fortunate to work in the lab of Dr. Rakesh
Mishra at CCMB for six years. His guidance and the lab atmosphere was inspiring and motivational. I worked on several small projects like identifying RNA component of nuclear matrix, dynamics of nuclear matrix proteome and Matrix associated regions (MARs). With experience in chemistry, genetics and chromatin biology and in trying to establish my own lab, I moved to GITAM in August 2010. 

At GITAM, I started doing both basic and translational research and chose silkworm model organism. I have completed 15 years of my stay at GITAM. I have carried out several projects funded by DBT, UGC and BRNS. At present, two projects sponsored by MOES and DBT are being carried out in the lab. Nine Ph.D. students were awarded degrees under my guidance, and one student is currently pursuing her Ph.D. Several M.Sc. students were guided for their project work. Thirty peer reviewed research papers in reputed international journals were published.
